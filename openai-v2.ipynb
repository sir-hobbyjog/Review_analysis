It features some decent set-pieces, but the plot is occasionally unclear and the humor doesn't always hit the mark.\", 'Action movies of this scale often start off strong and wind down to forgettable finales, but Percy Jackson is the opposite, overcoming a clunky setup to deliver nearly all its thrills in the last half-hour.': 'The review highlights that unlike many action movies, \"Percy Jackson\" improves as it progresses. It has a flawed beginning but compensates with an exciting and thrilling final half-hour.', \"The Lightning Thief is all crass ineptitude and lost potential. Columbus' infantilizing of any character depth and use of leftover Harry Potter special effects will amuse only the smallest in your pantheon.\": 'The reviewer criticizes \"The Lightning Thief\" for its lack of depth and wasted potential, likening it to a simplified version of \"Harry Potter\" with unimpressive special effects. They suggest it may only appeal to a very young audience.', 'The plot is a pretty blatant rehash of the typical \"coming-of-age hero\" tropes. Still, while \"Percy Jackson\" may not end up being the next huge and successful franchise, at the very least, it was an honest and amusing two hours.': 'The review suggests that while the plot of \"Percy Jackson\" heavily relies on familiar \"coming-of-age hero\" tropes and may not achieve massive franchise success, it still offers an enjoyable and entertaining two-hour experience.', \"Young viewers probably will be entertained but even they are likely to realize that this could have and should have been better, especially by the time they're old enough to drive.\": \"The review suggests that while young viewers might find the content entertaining, they'll likely recognize its shortcomings as they grow older.\", \"It raises issues it doesn't have the balls to resolve by placing them in a context it doesn't have the brains to exploit.\": 'The review criticizes the work for introducing important issues but failing to address or develop them effectively.', 'Whew boy.': 'The review indicates a strong reaction, suggesting an intense or memorable experience, but does not provide specific details.', \"My problems with it are the same as with most screen adaptations of young adult novels...they spend so much time struggling to explain the world they're creating that they forget which parts of the story people want to see...they figure that people (kids)\": \"This review critiques the screen adaptation of a young adult novel for focusing too much on world-building at the expense of the story's key elements, which are what viewers, particularly younger ones, actually want to see.\", 'Sadly worthy of its dumping into the cinematic boneyard of wintry mid-February.': 'The review suggests that the film is of poor quality and deserves its release during the less prestigious mid-February slot.', 'The camera work is frequently pedestrian, the acting is bland, and the jokes often fall flat.': 'The review criticizes the film for its uninspired camera work, dull acting, and unfunny jokes.', \"Director Chris Columbus has brought together the modern and mythical spheres with sharp pacing and a nifty sense of fun that atone for the film's dippier moments. It's his most enjoyable effort since Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.\": \"Director Chris Columbus successfully blends modern and mythical elements with a fast pace and a playful tone, overshadowing the film's minor flaws.
